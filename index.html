	<h1>Take a walk on the wild side with small batch organic kombucha tea, brewed locally in Thetford, Vermont.</h1>

	<h2>Our Kombucha</h2>

	<p>Each batch of Wild Side Kombucha is made with a blend of organic oolong, green, and white tea. The kombucha then ferments 7 to 10 days under lively SCOBYs in an environment of love and happiness. Once properly fermented, flavors are added for a 2-5 day second fermentation period, resulting in wonderfully refreshing, tasty, and healthful beverages that will rock your world.</p>

	<h2>Kombucha C.S.A.!</h2>

	<p>Wild Side Kombucha has been shared with friends, colleagues, and family members since 2014 and is now in its launch phase as a small business. While not yet available in stores, our kombucha tea is available as a Kombucha C.S.A. (Community Supported Agriculture) in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire. The cost options for a 10-week C.S.A. are <em>$220 for two 1/2-gallon growlers per week or $110 for one 1/2-gallon growler per week</em> (plus $6 or $3 bottle deposit). Learn more or request additional information about joining the C.S.A. [[here]].</p>

	<h2>The Brewer Behind Wild Side Kombucha</h2>

	<p>Health coach, snowboarder, backpacker, and all-around fun dad Chris Spelman started Wild Side Kombucha out of his love for this amazing beverage and a strong desire to bring great kombucha and happiness to as many people as possible. To Chris, nothing beats the look of joy he sees when people try a new or particularly great batch of kombucha tea.
